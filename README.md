# tax
Designing a website that allows for tax calculation based on a users input.

This code is a simple tax calculator web application.

Describing what in the code:
1. The user enters their Gross Annual Income, Extra Income, and Deductions in the form fields. They also select their age range from a dropdown menu.
2. The code checks if the user has entered valid numbers in the input fields and if they have selected an age range. If there are any errors, it displays an error icon next to the corresponding field.
3. If the inputs are valid, the code calculates the overall income by adding the Gross Annual Income and Extra Income, and then subtracting the Deductions.
4. Based on the user's age range, the code applies a different tax rate to the taxable income (the amount over 8 lakhs). The tax rates are 30% for age under 40, 40% for age 40 to 60, and 10% for age 60 and above.
5. The calculated tax amount is then displayed in a modal window.

The code also includes some CSS styles and Bootstrap libraries to make the form and modal look better. Overall, it's a simple tax calculation tool that helps users understand how much tax they might need to pay based on their income and age.
